# Probabilistic robotics project "Planar monocular SLAM".
Final project of the probabilistic robotics course of the a.y. 2022/2023 held by professor Giorgio Grisetti. 
\
The aim of this project is to solve a SLAM system by developing a Total Least Square algorithm. The scenario is the following: a differential drive robot moving in a 2D environment sensing 3D landmarks by a monocular camera.
Input of the problem:
\
 - wheeled odometry
 \
 - camera parameters (extrinsics and intrinsics)
 \
 - stream of point projections with the real "id"
